cplusplus2011-tour
==================
bert.hubert@netherlabs.nl

Small tour of some notable C++2011 features. This is definitely not an
attempt to cover everything, just some immediately and universally useful
new features.

Compiles with g++ 4.7.2. 

Much inspiration from Bjarne Stroustrup's C++2011 FAQ on
